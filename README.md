# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
I have used the dataset availiable on the Kaggle to build the heart disease prediction system using Machine Learning

This project is currently under development. The project repository contains a Jupyter notebook file. I have performed the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and split the data into training and testing sets in the notebook file. Furthermore, I have applied machine learning algorithms and achieved an accuracy of 64%. Although this is not impressive,but the project is still in the development phase, and I will be conducting further EDA. Additionally, I have decided to build a web app for this project.
